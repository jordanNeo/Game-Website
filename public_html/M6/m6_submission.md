Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once). You may however change such values through game logic during runtime. (i.e., when points are scored, boundaries are hit, some action occurs, etc)</li></ol></li><li>Evidence/Screenshots<ol><li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your first significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li><li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li><li>Remember to include your ucid/date as comments in any screenshots that have code</li><li>Ensure your screenshots load and are visible from the md file in step 9</li></ol></li><li>In the M6 folder create a new file called m6_submission.md</li><li>Save your below responses, generate the markdown, and paste the output to this file</li><li>Add/commit/push all related files as necessary</li><li>Merge your pull request once you're satisfied with the .md file and the canvas game mods</li><li>Create a new pull request from dev to prod and merge it</li><li>Locally checkout dev and pull the merged changes from step 12</li></ol><p>Each missed or failed to follow instruction is eligible for -0.25 from the final grade</p></td></tr></table>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned how to interact with objects on html5 canvas and how to<br>begin to make things do what I want them to in a simple<br>game. I still need to code more to understand but I have a<br>better understanding of how to give objects a simple function and interact with<br>other things on the canvas. I also learned how to control things with<br>keyboard inputs on canvas. I understand how to use functions to make objects<br>and how math is heavily ingrained in game design.<br></p><br></td></tr>
